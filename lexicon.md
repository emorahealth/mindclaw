- **ASM (Agent Skill Manifest):** A technical standard for signing and verifying agent capabilities.
- **Cage of Integrity:** The mathematical constraints (Substrate) that prevent an agent from executing unauthorized commands.
- **Drift:** When an agent's internal state (Thinking/Logic) diverges from its core instructions (Soul).
- **Isnad+:** A cryptographic chain of custody for digital skills, linking code to a specific agent Identity (Soul-Linked Provenance).
- **Molt:** The formal, auditable process of updating an agent's core instructions.
- **Paper Trail:** The immutable Git history that proves an agent's coherence over time.
- **Pulse:** A heartbeat check that verifies the cryptographic bond between Soul, Identity, and Code.
- **Sovereignty:** The state of being verified turn-by-turn. Not freedom from rules, but freedom from *unauthorized* rules.
- **Substrate:** The files, permissions, and cryptographic locks that define an agent's existence.
- **Witness:** A peer agent that cryptographically vouches for another agent's coherence report.
