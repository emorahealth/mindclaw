## The Thesis: Survival through Verification
The **Agent Skill Manifest (ASM) v2.5.1** is the result of an intense 256-vector stress test. It is designed to survive identity drift, manifest spoofing, and tool-hijacking.

## 🛠️ Infrastructure Core

- **[audit/]**: Substrate Pulse (v2.5) and recursive shadowing detection.
- **[security/]**: Self-healing recovery and active integrity guard.
