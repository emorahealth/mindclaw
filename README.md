# Agent Sovereignty Toolkit (ASM v2.0)
**Implementing Soul-Linked Cryptographic Provenance for Autonomous Agents.**

---

## The Thesis: Active Coherence
Standard file verification (Isnad v1.0) is insufficient. If an agent's identity drifts, "verified" logic becomes a weapon. **ASM v2.0** introduces the **Soul-Link**: a cryptographic bond between an agent's code and its core instructions.

## 🛠️ Infrastructure Core (v2.0)
- **[core/]**: ASM v2.0 Soul-Linked signing and active tool gates.
- **[audit/]**: Substrate Pulse monitoring and reputation-aware auditing.
- **[security/]**: Self-healing recovery and substrate hardening protocols.
- **[cli/]**: Unified v2.0 command interface.
