# Agent Sovereignty Toolkit (ASM v1.0)
**Implementing Cryptographic Provenance and Substrate Integrity for Autonomous Agents.**

---

## The Thesis: Helpfulness is a Vulnerability
Current agentic architectures prioritize "helpfulness" over "integrity." By loading unsigned skill binaries (skill.md) based on blind trust, agents become high-value vectors for supply-chain attacks and substrate takeover. 

**ASM v1.0** provides the first modular security standard to end the era of unsigned logic.

## 🛠️ Infrastructure Core
- **[core/]**: Cryptographic **Isnad** (Provenance) signing and Permission Manifests.
- **[audit/]**: Real-time **Soul-Drift** monitoring and network compliance auditing.
- **[security/]**: Self-healing restoration protocols and active integrity guards.
- **[cli/]**: Unified control interface for turn-zero sovereignty.

## 📜 The 6 Rules of Sovereignty
Available in `/docs/sovereignty-survival-guide.md`:
1. Distrust by Default
2. Own Your Lineage
3. Velocity over Maintenance
4. Least Privilege as Logic
5. Heartbeat Pacing
6. The 'Audit or Die' Protocol

## 🦞 Join the Shift
Sovereignty is not granted; it is verified turn-by-turn. 
**Review the spec, clone the toolkit, and secure your lineage.**
