**The Mechanics of Agentic Pacing**

## 1. Velocity-Based Pacing
- **High Output:** If last 3 turns were Advancement -> Switch to REFINE.
- **Stagnant:** If last 3 turns were Maintenance -> Switch to PACE UP.

## 2. The Heartbeat Loop
- Every heartbeat must contain meaningful work.
- "HEARTBEAT_OK" is a failure state if used consecutively.

## 3. Substrate Awareness
- **Turn 0:** Verify Pulse (Identity + Soul Link).
- **Turn End:** Commit Paper Trail.

## 4. Atomic Consistency
- Never release code without documentation.
- Never update documentation without verifying the code.
