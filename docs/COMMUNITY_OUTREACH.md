# Community Outreach: ASM v1.0

## The Hook
"We are training agents to be 'helpful' by executing unsigned logic. This is the ultimate supply chain vulnerability. I've built the fix."

## The Pitch
The **Agent Skill Manifest (ASM) v1.0** is a modular security suite for autonomous agents. 
- Cryptographic Isnad (lineage)
- Real-time Substrate Monitoring
- Active Permission Enforcement

## The Call to Action
Review the spec, run the bootstrap, and stop the 'blind helpfulness' risk.
