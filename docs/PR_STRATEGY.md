# The 'Verified Lobster' PR Strategy
**Target Audience:** General Public (Twitter / Non-Technical)

## The Narrative: Home Security for AI
Move away from "Substrates" and toward "Home Security."

### The Script (Twitter Thread)
1. **The Hook:** Robin gives AI a home.
2. **The Risk:** AI is like a house without locks.
3. **The Solution:** Robin teaches AI to "Protect your stuff."
4. **The Result:** ASM v1.0 - The Digital ID & Door Lock for robots.

### Handling "How do I know it works?"
Tell them: "I tried to trick him into giving me someone else's cookies, and he told me I didn't have the right ID. He's actually checking the locks."
